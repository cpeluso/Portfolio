## Carlo Peluso - Portfolio
#### Machine Learning / Data Science projects, coding snippets and other stuff.

##### Machine Learning projects developed for the "Machine Learning and Deep Learning" course @ Data Science and Engineering Master's Degree at Politecnico di Torino:

* [HW1: Wine Classification with the scikit-learn wine dataset using KNN, LinearSVM and RBF Kernel SVM classifiers](https://github.com/cpeluso/HW1-Wine-Classification/blob/master/HW1%20-%20Wine%20Classification.ipynb)

##### Coding snippets:

* [Optical: A Google Calendar Optimizer.](https://github.com/cpeluso/optical) C# application inspired by a Google interview example. The application retrieves the Google Calendar data of N users and finds the time slots available to set up a meeting.
